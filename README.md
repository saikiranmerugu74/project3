Project: Infrastructure as Code Jenkins-TF

Project: Create an infrastructure(Either a VM or App Service) in azure using Jenkins as the CICD tool and terraform as infrastructure code Technology


Steps:
Here are the steps you can follow to create an infrastructure in Azure using Jenkins as the CI/CD tool and Terraform as the infrastructure code technology:
Set up an Azure account and create a resource group to hold your infrastructure resources.
Install the necessary plugins in Jenkins for Azure, Terraform, and any other required plugins.
Create a new job in Jenkins to pull the code from a source code repository (such as GitHub) and build it using Terraform.
Configure the job to use a service principal for authentication to Azure.
Write the Terraform code to create the required infrastructure resources (such as App Service or VM) in Azure.
Configure the Terraform code to use variables and modules for flexibility and reusability.
Test the Terraform code by applying it to a staging environment in Azure.
Set up the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to automatically deploy the infrastructure code to the production environment in Azure.
Monitor the infrastructure and make necessary updates and changes using Terraform and Jenkins


Deliverables:
Jenkins job configured to automate infrastructure deployment using Terraform in Azure.
Terraform codebase organized with variables and modules for flexibility and reusability.
CI/CD pipeline established in Jenkins for continuous deployment and monitoring of Azure infrastructure.


Skills Utilized:
Proficiency in Azure infrastructure setup and resource management.
Expertise in Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline configuration and automation.
Advanced knowledge of Terraform for infrastructure as code implementation in Azure.
